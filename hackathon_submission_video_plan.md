- Bearlover365 avatar show. Bearlovers United attempt sock picking AND then
  the ultimate challenge of... Co-hosted berlin
- Socks are deformable objects, winnie the pooh meme
    - easy to grasp but hard to detect + understand
    - therefore so many more configurations for the model to learn
- Saturday 14th June: basic sock picking and immediately drop
- Sunday 15th June: Socks into box!
- 40k steps
- Challenges
- A few months ago, I actually have some experience with Johnny the humanoid picking socks, but this was with a classic visual servo'ing based approach. Drowned in complexity. Got stuck with putting the socks into a red hamper at home. Luckily in comes LeRobot and imitation learning with ACT model. Which is the tech I'm pivoting into from classic robotics. It's clearly the future of robotics, combined with RL, VLAs and better representations.

- Next steps:
    - mobile manipulation e.g. with leKiwi or Johnny the humanoid and pick up all my girlfriend's socks on the floor of my apartment
